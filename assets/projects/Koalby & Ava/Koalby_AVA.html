      <h2>üìê CAD and ANSYS Analysis</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Detailed 3D models were created using CAD software to accurately design each part of the robot, from the arms to the legs. These designs were then subjected to force analysis in ANSYS, where Free Body Diagrams helped identify stress points, allowing for targeted improvements in structural integrity.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved structural integrity by redesigning the pelvis, chest, and spine based on CAD models.</li>
        <li>Performed multivariable torque analysis for motor standardization, ensuring optimal performance under various load conditions.</li>
      </ul>
