      <h2>üîç Project Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li>The project aimed to create a reliable amplification system that increased the input force by a factor of 2.5, meeting the safety requirements for elevators.</li><br>
        <li>Involved designing and assembling a system that fits within the constrained space provided, while achieving the required force amplification using a rack and pinion mechanism.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>üîß Design and Fabrication</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The force amplification system was built using a rack and pinion design. Key components were carefully selected based on gear specifications, space constraints, and material strength.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Used laser-cut wood and steel for structural components to ensure stability and precision.</li>
        <li>Incorporated a gear and rack system with a steel frame to ensure durability and meet amplification requirements.</li>
        <li>Created a test rig to simulate the system's functionality, verifying static and dynamic performance.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Testing and Results Section -->
    <section class="testing-results fade-in">
      <h2>üß™ Testing and Results</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The system was subjected to both static and dynamic tests to ensure that it met the desired force amplification and response time.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Static Testing: Verified a consistent 2.5x amplification factor with input forces around 40N.</li>
        <li>Dynamic Testing: Measured time response and travel distance, achieving an average response time of 0.112 seconds.</li>
        <li>Results: Successfully demonstrated a force amplification factor of 2.58, surpassing the target.</li>
      </ul>
